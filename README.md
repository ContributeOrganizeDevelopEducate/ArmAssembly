# ArmAssembly
ARM now being used widely in embedded as well as general purpose applications. A wide range of compilers available for free under gnu gcc for arm. This makes easy to use 'C' language for programming ARM. However studying ARM assembly helps to understand different architectures of ARM. This also helps getting an understanding of how to debug a code written for ARM. Moreover writing assembly heps to improve the analytical skills.

This repository mainly focus on the documentation part of ARM assembly. We try to make the assembly instructions as simple as possible in order to give an understanding of basic architecture of ARM. The documentaion is prepared using LaTex. The main documantation file is named as arm_assembly.tex. It is unorganized, so if anyone wants to contribute can either directly put their thoughts in the main file or they can create a seperate Tex file under the branch "Inputs". Later it can be reviewed, organized and add into the main file.

This aim of creating this repository is not just creating a documentaion regarding ARM assembly as it is available in the arm info center and well documented. This repository more focus on documentation through different algorithms, optimizations, interfaces, board specific examples etc. The contrbutor is free to chose any example for this purpose, but try to make it more understandable and portable.


Thanks and welcome to CODE.

Share your knowledge it's a way to achieve immortality.
